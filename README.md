# Half-Ride

Half Ride is my first android application. For college Project Based Learning we had an idea to make an android application that can allow students to find commute partners that are form the same college. This application allows you to ping to a certain person sending them a notification showing them that both live nearby and are willing to commute together. Me and my gf met the same way. Hence i made this application. 99% of the code is written by me. Without prior experience with Java, I just followed simple tutorials from different applications and learnt how it should be made. Took 3 months to make, quite bad design and dont have any security. However might work on it later.

## Features for now- 
1.Making a profile with google account

2.Can look at other profiles

3.Can change profile details and add a Description

## Features to be added-
1.Ping_ pings work. However they are displayed for everyone. Going to make it only notify the person that has been pinged

2.Google Maps area/location Selection

3.Filter Profile display on dashboard based on organization and location

4.Chat
